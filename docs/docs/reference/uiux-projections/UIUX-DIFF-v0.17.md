# UI/UX Evolution Report (v0.9 → v0.17)

This report documents the structural evolution of the Validation Lab's user interface and its relationship to the underlying protocol SSOT.

## 1. Phase 1: v0.9 – v0.12 (Establishing Discovery)
*   **Focus**: Basic discoverability and ruleset listing.
*   **IA Shift**: Introduced `/rulesets` and `/runs` as separate evidence silos.
*   **Anchor Strategy**: Direct file-to-path mapping; no centralized manifest.

## 2. Phase 2: v0.13 – v0.15 (Integrity & Coverage)
*   **Focus**: Reproducibility and Domain Breadth.
*   **IA Shift**: Introduced `/coverage` (Matrix view) and `/validation` (early integrity check).
*   **Anchor Strategy**: Introduction of the `lab-manifest.json` as the unified anchor source.

## 3. Phase 3: v0.16 – v0.17 (Explainability & Finality)
*   **Focus**: Forensic explainability and institutional finality.
*   **IA Shift**: Introduced `/rulesets/evolution` (Explainable Diff) and the **v1.0 Validation Dashboard**.
*   **Anchor Strategy**: Final hardening of the `SEAL-v0.17.0` triad and dynamic UI injection.

## 4. Structural Invariants (Frozen v1.0)
*   Routes are now **STATIONARY**.
*   All UI anchors are dynamically resolved from the `lab-manifest.json` `anchors` block.
*   The mapping is now audit-grade and bit-identical.
