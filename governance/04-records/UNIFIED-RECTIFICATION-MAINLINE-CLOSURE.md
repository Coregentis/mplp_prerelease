# Unified Rectification Mainline Closure

**Status**: CLOSED  
**Closure State**: BASELINE ESTABLISHED  
**Closure Date**: 2026-03-28  
**Scope**: Repository governance realignment baseline

---

## 1. Purpose

This record closes the unified rectification mainline that began from the cross-surface consistency audit and continued through governance, truth-chain, ownership, version-taxonomy, and cleanup enforcement work.

The purpose of this closure record is to declare that the following baseline is now established and no longer open for re-litigation as part of the same mainline:

1. entry model and authority structure
2. Validation Lab truth-chain binding
3. Validation Lab / Validation_Lab_V2 ownership boundary
4. version-domain taxonomy
5. cleanup enforcement for local paths, stale commands, and dependency-alignment notes

---

## 2. Closure Decision

The unified rectification mainline is hereby declared:

**CLOSED**

More specifically:

**Repository Governance Realignment Baseline — ESTABLISHED**

This means future work MUST treat the following as baseline rather than open design debate:

- `3+1 constitutional entry model`
- `4 public-facing surfaces`
- scoped authority model
- Validation Lab truth source = root protocol truth source for invariants
- `Validation_Lab` as the only authoritative Lab home in this repository governance scope
- `Validation_Lab_V2` as non-authoritative `engineering_track`
- explicit version-domain taxonomy
- executable cleanup and governance gates

---

## 3. Completed Stages

### 3.1 P0-A Entry Model Realignment

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Commits**:
- `d116be179` — governance: realign entry model and document metadata model
- `269de7a90` — governance: ratify entry model realignment for validation lab and v2
- `8329f3b5d` — docs: align readme wording to 3+1 entry model and four surfaces
- `b64d00edd` — ops: enforce entry model realignment with executable gates

**Gate Baseline**:
- `gate:entry-model-realignment`

**Effect**:
- constitutional model, public surface model, and scoped authority model were aligned and made executable

### 3.2 P0-B Lab Truth Chain Repair

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Commits**:
- `5222d085d` — lab: repair invariant truth chain to schemas v2 source
- `7f883788b` — lab: resync invariant mirror and record truth chain manifest
- `5f9982eb3` — ops: add validation lab truth chain verification entrypoints

**Gate Baseline**:
- `Validation_Lab: gate:lab-truth-chain`
- `Validation_Lab: gate:vlab:01`

**Effect**:
- Validation Lab invariant truth chain was re-bound to `schemas/v2/invariants`

### 3.3 P0-C V2 Ownership Collapse

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Main Repository Commits**:
- `f192877c4` — governance: designate validation lab as authoritative lab home
- `020f53b98` — lab: collapse v2 ownership into non-authoritative engineering track
- `204edb041` — ops: enforce authoritative lab home and v2 ownership collapse

**Validation_Lab_V2 Subrepository Commit**:
- `541e077` — docs: mark validation lab v2 as non-authoritative engineering track

**Gate Baseline**:
- `gate:v2-ownership-collapse`

**Effect**:
- `Validation_Lab` is now the only authoritative Lab home in this repository governance scope
- `Validation_Lab_V2` is explicitly reduced to non-authoritative `engineering_track`

### 3.4 P1 Version Taxonomy Manifest

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Commits**:
- `21543d024` — governance: define version taxonomy manifest and domain model
- `54456c56c` — docs: align key governance and lab records to version domain taxonomy
- `27dd87344` — ops: enforce version taxonomy manifest and domain alignment

**Gate Baseline**:
- `gate:version-taxonomy`

**Effect**:
- version semantics are now expressed through explicit version domains rather than a single floating version label

### 3.5 P2 Cleanup Sweep

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Commits**:
- `550f4c482` — cleanup: remove local file urls and stale absolute path references
- `ef1a2b9bd` — docs: sweep stale commands, paths, and residual legacy wording
- `5ab5b2e1e` — ops: align dependency governance and cleanup execution wiring

**Gate Baseline**:
- `gate:cleanup-sweep`

**Effect**:
- scoped local-path cleanup, stale command/path cleanup, and dependency-alignment cleanup have been enforced for the mainline targets

---

## 4. Established Baseline

The repository now has a five-layer governance baseline:

1. **Legal / Constitutional Layer**
   - entry model and authority model frozen
2. **Truth-Chain Layer**
   - Validation Lab invariants bound to root truth source
3. **Ownership Layer**
   - authoritative Lab home fixed
4. **Version Semantics Layer**
   - version domains frozen and executable
5. **Cleanup / Execution Layer**
   - local-path, stale-command, and dependency-alignment cleanup gates executable

This is not merely a one-time remediation. It is now a maintained governance baseline enforced by executable gates.

---

## 5. Residual Items Outside This Mainline

The following items are explicitly NOT part of the unified rectification mainline closure decision:

- `.DS_Store` working-tree noise
- `MPLP_website` subrepository local modifications
- `Validation_Lab_V2` subrepository local modifications unrelated to the ownership-collapse governance change
- `governance/audits/2026-03-27-cross-surface-consistency-audit.md`
- SDK / schema mirror drift global repair
- further website-specific governance alignment work
- further archive cleanup or historical file normalization

These are residual or independent workstreams. They do not block closure of the unified rectification mainline.

---

## 6. Future Work Handling Rule

From this closure point forward:

- new work MUST NOT reopen this mainline unless it explicitly challenges one of the established baseline decisions;
- ordinary future work should be opened as independent workstreams;
- remaining technical debt should be tracked outside this closure record unless it directly invalidates an established baseline gate.

---

## 7. Non-Goals

This closure record does NOT:

- claim that the entire repository is free of historical debt,
- claim that every archived or low-priority document has been normalized,
- or claim that all subrepository drift is resolved.

It closes the unified rectification mainline only.
